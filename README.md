# 3DLineDetection
A simple and efficient 3D line detection algorithm for large scale unorganized point cloud

Prerequisites:
---
1. OpenCV > 2.4.x
2. OpenMP
3. No other libs

Usage:
---
1. build the project with Cmake
2. run the code

Performance:
---
On a computer with Intel Core i5-3550p CPU, the computing time for point clouds with 30M, 20M, 10M, 5M, 2M and 1M points is 130s, 80s, 40s, 20s, 8s and 4s, respectively.
